danetrack 0.0.1

A tool to track pupils' progress with iPad maths apps at Danetree,
consisting of a backend, implemented in R, that generates plots of
assessment results from a CSV file.  A Perl script provides a more
n00b-friendly interface, and a shell script and batch file are
included to "just run it", without having to interact with the
terminal or Cygwin proper.

Plots are output as PNG files to the user's desktop.

Requirements:
- Perl 5
- R
- Cygwin (if on Windows)
